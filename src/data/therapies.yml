  **Shamanic Empowering and Healing**
  My shamanic healing, empowering and divinatory methods includes dances, songs, mantras, music
  instruments (shamanic drums, bells, lyra) and tarot. The client is generally laying down with closed
  eyes. The client is invited to open to the healing process, be prepared for change and 
  transformation and stay focus on his/her demand.

  **Psycho-Shamanic Therapy**
  Integrating ancestral shamanic medicine into psychotherapeutic, interviews offer faster, deeper,
  holistic, and sustainable results – and in harmony with your personal resources and power. My
  therapeutic spectrum is broad enough to take in charge many psychological and psychiatric 
  disorders and provide you with support, hope and perspective in case of mental and/or organic 
  illness and difficulties. I promise you an approach without dependency or rigid psychiatric 
  categorization.
