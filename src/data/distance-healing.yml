    ### Ethics and rules codex

    - Do good, always. With kindness, patience, respect, compassion, tenderness, and unconditional love. In serving others, you cultivate joyful effort and self-giving. You act in accordance with the legal framework, human rights and for the good of all beings.
    -  I make sure that the patient consents. Distance healing requires a clear and explicit consent from the client. Ideally the patient is present, aware, audible, and visible in front of the camera and the internet connection allows an exchange. Parents gives consent if the child is not of speaking age or average.
    -  Shamanic sessions do not replace classical medicine. I make sure that the patient consults a doctor in addition or contact the emergency services. Shamanic sessions do not hinder or delay the work of the doctors in any way.
    -  I have the duty to postpone or refuse a session, in case of clear emergency if the patient is categorically refusing to contact a doctor or the police.
    -  I have the right and the duty to refuse treatment if I feel incompetent for the case or if I’m embarrassed by the request.
    -  I behave with humility, and I renounce to give my opinion on medical prescriptions.
    -  I do not prescribe diet, fasting or any kind of cure or substances.
    -  Shamanic session for animals is allowed. Ideally the animal should be present, visible and can hear the practitioner.
    -  Even in case of a large-scale disaster, war, nature disaster, pandemic… collective distance healing (for a community, group, region, or other large spatial area) is not allowed. Shamanic assistance should be provided on an individual level only.
    - I act with awareness and sense of responsibility towards LET'S BE HAPPY
    -  I respect the pricing strategy.
    -  I document my sessions as well as my income.
    -  I do not use the time allocated to the treatment to advertise and make publicity.
