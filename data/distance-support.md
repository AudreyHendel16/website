### Communication and advertising

Help us by talking about our project and <span class="pink">**LET'S BE HAPPY**</span> around you. Few know the effectiveness, the wisdom and the beauty of shamanism, an ancestral method of knowledge, healing, empowering and transformation. Let’s become visible and let know we are here, ready to  act, ready to help.

Isn't it wonderful and miraculous to be able to empower and serve sentient beings in difficulty all over the planet?

Digital advances, the use of English, and shamanic collaboration with Spirits, allow us to act with compassion on an international level. It is our responsibility, in the face of the challenges ahead, to seize this opportunity to serve others.

<p class="featured_text">
« The voices of the shamans have gone unheard long enough. It is time to raise those voices 
again. It is time to act. This is not only a recommendation given our responsibility to 
upcoming generations, it is a mandate for our future.»<br>
Roland Urban, Mag.<br>
Director of the Foundation for Shamanic Studies Europe.
